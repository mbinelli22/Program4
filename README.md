Getting user input and checking if it is a double literal.

• Prompts the user to input exactly four characters, which constitude a valid double literal in Java.
• Gets whatever the user enters and stores it into a String variable, using the the Scanner ’s .nextLine()
method.

• Determines if the input string is indeed a valid four character double literal :
1. Consists of exactly the following characters: ’+’, ’-’, ’.’ (decimal point), and ’0’ through ’9’
2. Either the ’+’ or ’-’ character may appear only as the first character
3. The ’.’ (decimal point) character must appear exactly once
4. All other characters must be the ’0’ through ’9’ characters
